def guessing_game():
    """
    Plays a number guessing game with the user.

    This interactive game demoonstrates while loops, conditionals, and user input handling. The user attempts to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100, receiving feedback after each guess.

    Game Flow:
    1. Generate a random secret number between 1 and 100 (inclusive)
    2. Prompt the user with clear instructions
    3. Use a while loop to continue until the user guesses correctly
    4. For each guess:
        - Convert the input to an integer
        - Compare the guess to the secret number
        - Provide feedback: "Too low!", "Too high!", or "success"
    5. When correct, congratulate user and show number of attempts
    6. Exit the game

    Input Validation:
    - Assume user will enter valid integers (error handling not required)

    Example Game Session:
    --------
    Welcome to the Number Guessing Game!
    I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.
    Enter your guess: 50
    Too high! Try again.
    Enter your guess: 25
    Too low! Try again.
    Enter your guess: 37
    Congratulations! You've guessed itin 3 attempts!
